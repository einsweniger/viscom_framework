When querying/requesting a noise value at\n// an arbitrary point in the plane, the grid cell in which the query is performed is\n// determined (line 32), the four vertices of the grid are determined and their random\n// vectors fetched (lines 37 to 40). Then, the position of the current point under \n// evaluation relative to each vertex is doted (projected) with that vertex' random\n// vector, and the result is bilinearly interpolated (lines 37 to 40 again) with a \n// smooth interpolant (line 33 and 35).\n\n\n// Value    Noise 2D, Derivatives: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dXBRH\n// Gradient Noise 2D, Derivatives: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXBRH\n// Value    Noise 3D, Derivatives: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsXfRH\n// Gradient Noise 3D, Derivatives: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dffRH\n// Value    Noise 2D             : https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3WH\n// Value    Noise 3D             : https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sfGzS\n// Gradient Noise 2D             : https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGW8\n// Gradient Noise 3D             : https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xsl3Dl\n// Simplex  Noise 2D             : https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Msf3WH\n\n\nvec2 hash( vec2 x )  // replace this by something better\n{\n    const vec2 k = vec2( 0.3183099, 0.3678794 );\n    x = x*k + k.yx;\n    return -1.0 + 2.0*fract( 16.0 * k*fract( x.x*x.y*(x.x+x.y)) );\n}\n\nfloat noise( in vec2 p )\n{\n    vec2 i = floor( p );\n    vec2 f = fract( p );\n\t\n\tvec2 u = f*f*(3.0-2.0*f);\n\n    return mix( mix( dot( hash( i + vec2(0.0,0.0) ), f - vec2(0.0,0.0) ), \n                     dot( hash( i + vec2(1.0,0.0) ), f - vec2(1.0,0.0) ), u.x),\n                mix( dot( hash( i + vec2(0.0,1.0) ), f - vec2(0.0,1.0) ), \n                     dot( hash( i + vec2(1.0,1.0) ), f - vec2(1.0,1.0) ), u.x), u.y);\n}\n\n// -----------------------------------------------\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n    vec2 p = fragCoord.xy / iResolution.xy;\n\n\tvec2 uv = p*vec2(iResolution.x/iResolution.y,1.0);\n\t\n\tfloat f = 0.0;\n\t\n    // left: noise\t\n\tif( p.x<0.6 )\n\t{\n\t\tf = noise( 32.0*uv );\n\t}\n    // right: fractal noise (4 octaves)\n    else\t\n\t{\n\t\tuv *= 8.0;\n        mat2 m = mat2( 1.6,  1.2, -1.2,  1.6 );\n\t\tf  = 0.5000*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.2500*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.1250*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t\tf += 0.0625*noise( uv ); uv = m*uv;\n\t}\n\n\tf = 0.5 + 0.5*f;\n\t\n    f *= smoothstep( 0.0, 0.005, abs(p.x-0.6) );\t\n\t\n\tfragColor = vec4( f, f, f, 1.0 );\n}",
